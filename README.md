# Crowdfunding Analysis

## Analysis Summary
In this ananlysis we will show how the different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the available dataset that ywe have created, weâ€™ll provide you a visualized campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. Hoping to achieve an understanding of the successful campaigns' contributor factors and create your camapign that is tailered towards the sucess from the begining. 

## Analysis and Challenges:

During the this analysis we primarily used excel as our analysis tool for data analysis and visualization. Possible Challenges that one may encounter during the similar analysis will be as followings:
- Data is not enough to drive conclusion
- A large missing data points
- Having difficulties to effectively use excel formula
- Having difficulties to select the best visualization based on the common best practices


### Part1-Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

This analysis is conducted based on the "Theater" campaigns with all available data between the year of 1970 to 2017.

Findings:
1. Most of the successful campaigns were funded during early summer time, especially May and June would the best time for organizing a fund raising campaign.
2. Last quarter of the year potentially is the worse time of a year for organizing campaigns. Especially in December, number of failed campaigns increased and number of successful campaigns decreased.

Limitation of this dataset and analysis result:
- Campaign main category is limited to the "Theater" type, the result may change based on a different campaign category.
- Number of canceled campaigns stayed largely flat throughout the months. We cannot drove definite conclusion on how is the launch date relate to the cause of the cancelations.

### Part2- Campaigns Outcomes based on Goals
This analysis is conducted with the goal of understanding how a Campaign goal level will impact the success rate a campaign. We first divided the campaign dataset goal amounts into 12 categories. Then we grouped the the number of campaigns in each categories and by the different outcomes.

Findings:
1. Campaigns with less than $1000 goals have the highest success rate, this might be easier for majority of people to contribute.
2. As the campaigns goals amount increased the success rate drops and percentage of failed campaigns increases. Especially, starting with the goal of 20K, the percentage of successful campaigns drop significantly decreased and percentages of failed campaigns increased drastically.

Limitation of this dataset and analysis result:
- Campaign sub-category is limited to the "plays" type, the result may change based on a different campaign category.
- The general trend is: the higher the goal of a campaign, the number failed campaigns increases. However, we between the goal amount of 35K to 45k, we have higher percentage of successful campaigns. Hence, further analysis required to identify what else contributed to the success of these campaigns with goals between 5K to 45k.



Other possible visualization options:

1. Visualize the Outcomes by Launch Date chart with different categories.
2. Visualize the Outcomes based on Goals chart with a bar chart instead of a line graph.


Thanks!
